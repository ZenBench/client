Q: What's this?
A: It's a patch to Solar Designer's "john the ripper" password cracker.

Q: What's it good for, then?
A: It enables cracking of Windows NT/2000 MD4 (case-sensitive) password hashes.

Q: Who made this?
A: This patch was thrown together on a boring Sunday by Olle Segerdahl.
   It uses Andrew Tridgell's NTLM and MD4 code stolen from samba-2.0.7 .

Q: How do I install it?
A: I assume you are able to install john from a source distribution,
   if you are not, PLEASE read john's documentation before e-mailing me. 
   To install run 'patch < john-ntlm-v02.diff' from the john "src" directory
   and then run 'make (your-system-type-here)' to build john.

Q: How do I use john to crack NT password hashes?
A: Use pwdump2 or L0phtcrack to dump the password hashes into a file,
   then run 'john pwfile -format:NT' to start cracking!

Q: I get all kinds of compile errors!
A: This patch was made against john-1.6.36, lots of stuff might have broken
   source compatibility since then... Use something closer to john-1.6.36.

Q: I have a question not covered by this FAQ!
A: Make sure you have read all there is to read about john, then
   mail me at olle@nxs.se with "JOHN-NTLM" in the subject.
