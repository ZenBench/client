Q: What's this?
A: It's a patch to Solar Designer's "john the ripper" password cracker.

Q: What's it good for, then?
A: It enables cracking of many different hashes. The list includes:
	- Kerberos AFS DES
	- Eggdrop Blowfish
	- OpenBSD Blowfish
	- BSDI DES
	- Traditional DES
	- NT LM DES
	- Lotus V5 web password
	- Apache MD5
	- FreeBSD MD5
	- MS Cache Hash
	- MYSQL
	- Netscape LDAP SHA
	- NTHASH (md4)
	- Raw MD5
	- Raw SHA1
	- Oracle

Q: Who made this?
A: The original patches are from the /contrib/ directory of john the ripper.
Their respective authors are shown on the john page, except:
	- Domino v5 by Jeff Fay
	- mscash, raw-md5, raw-sha1, hmac-md5, oracle 
	by Bartavelle@bandecon.com

Q: How do I install it?
A: I assume you are able to install john from a source distribution,
   if you are not, PLEASE read john's documentation before e-mailing me. 
   To install run 'gunzip -c john-1.6.37-bigpatch.x.ge | patch -p0' from the
   directory containing john   and then run 'make (your-system-type-here)' to 
   build john.

Q: NT hash support is broken!
A: NT hash support works with file whose format is:
USERNAME:$NT$A04B60AC43771EB386B94FEBAC779BBC
if your file looks that way:
USERNAME:A04B60AC43771EB386B94FEBAC779BBC
use the "-format:NT" option.

Q: It doesn't work!
A: This big patch has not been extensively tested. It should work most of the
time on all architectures. Please send all questions to bartavelle@bandecon.com

Thanks to:
Solar Designer for john and the advises
Arnaud Pilon for the MS Cash algorithm and the CacheDump tool
Moof (from thinko.net) for the macintosh shell
HP for their testdrive systems, and the fact they allow me to use john on their
servers.
